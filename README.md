# NEBULA Xplorer - a project by SRON
The NEBULA Xplorer website was given to us as a project from SRON, the Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands. Its primary purpose is being a deep source of information on everything to do with the NEBULA Xplorer, a sattelite designed to research X-ray binary black holes and their relationships with companion stars over long periods of time. The project as a whole is a combined effort of over 400 students from within the Netherlands.

**Our goals for this project are to build a multi-page website that:** 

- helps scientists visualize and interpret complex astronomical data from this mission
- assists engineers with explanations about the technologies of the instrument and satellite
- gives educational and industrial partners the opportunity to showcase themselves
- keeps students connected with each other

Our website includes a total of 7 main pages; Home, Mission, Scientific, News, Team, Careers and Partners. Four of these will eventually have their own detail pages, for example for articles, staff or partnership profiles, or job openings.
