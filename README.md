# Description of the project
A web-based interface for the Nebula Xplorer project at SRON, built with Svelte. Designed to explore, visualize, and interact with nebular data in an intuitive way. The project is about building a website for a new project within SRON that informs stakeholders about the project and invites them to work on the project or invest in the project.


# Installation information

## sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.


# Explaining design choices
The design choices made by the team are based on the briefing we had with Martin Grim of SRON. Here we discussed the necessities of the project and what it should look like. The new website should have the same look and feel of the current website and with the same style.
